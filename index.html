                    <p>Hurricanes are dangerous and destructive. Also known as cyclones or typhoons in other parts of
                        the world, hurricanes cause high winds, floods, torrential rains, and storm surges (huge waves).

                    <p>Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the
                        depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not dramatically increase in height. But as the waves
                        travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases.

                    <p>An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor) is the shaking of the surface of the
                        Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic
                        waves. Earthquakes can range in size from mild, cannot be felt to violents enough to propel
                        objects and people into the air, and wreak destruction across entire cities.</p>

                    <p>Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible in the form of a condensation
                        funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and
                        dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than 110 miles per hour (180 km/h), are
                        about 250 feet (80 m) across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.
